# JupyterSet
An exploration of ML via fast.ai and the SET card game.

The [Dissecting the Board](./Dissecting_the_board.ipynb) notebook that is an OpenCV attempt to find the cards and extract them, which I then manually classify into the training folder.

The [Train](./Train.ipynb) notebook tries to train a CNN to recognize the images.

This is my first project in ML, DL, fastai, Jupyter, and Python. So... be nice, but don't be quiet.
